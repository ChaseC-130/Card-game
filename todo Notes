Package ui into Electron in order to have as thick client (Desktop application)

Create backend using Socket.io

Connect to backend with client socket.io 

Implement IAM (Identity and access management, E,g, OAuth2?)

Design stateful UI entirely with as many variables as possible (No static defined values)
- Do not set mana from front end, instead send requet to backend, do calculations server side, re-render state
- All stateful variables should be compartminalized in their own component
